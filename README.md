# Ouroboros Network Protocol Documenation
There are two documents which describe various levels of the networking layer of the Cardano Node Shelley implementation:

  - [Introduction to the design of Data Diffusion and Networking of Cardano Shelley](https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/ouroboros-network/native.docs.x86_64-linux/latest/download/1)

  This document explains the technical requirements and key constraints for the networking
  layer of the _Cardano Shelley_ implementation of _Ouroboros Praos_.  This is
  a design document.

  - [The Shelley Networking Protocol](https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/ouroboros-network/native.docs.x86_64-linux/latest/download/2)
  
  This document is a technical specification of the networking protocol.  It
  includes serialisation formats, necessary details of multiplexer and
  technical specifications of mini-protocols used by either _node-to-node_ and
  _node-to-client_ flavors of the protocol.
  
## Wireshark Plug-in
  - [Wireshark Dissector for Ouroboros-Network in Lua](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/tree/master/ouroboros-network/wireshark-plugin)

## Emurgo CDDL CodeGen
  - [Emurgo/cddl-codegen](https://github.com/Emurgo/cddl-codegen)

  Codegen serialization logic for CBOR automatically from a CDDL specification.

  Instead of hand-writing CBOR code and writing tests to make sure it matches your CDDL spec, it's much faster to just generate the code from the spec! It will save time and make it easier to keep all your code in sync with any changes to your specification.

  You can learn more about [CDDL here](https://github.com/cbor-wg/cddl).
